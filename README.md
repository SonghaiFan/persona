## üöÄ Quick Start

### The 3-Step Resume Revolution

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
# 2. Edit data/profile.json with your information
# 3. Print the page - you get your resume done! üéâ
```

### Detailed Steps

### 1. Clone & Customize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SonghaiFan/persona.git
cd persona
```

### 2. Edit Your Data

Open `data/profile.json` and replace with your information:

```json
{
  "personal_info": {
    "first_name": "Your",
    "last_name": "Name",
    "first_name_pronounce": "your-pronunciation",
    "last_name_pronounce": "name-pronunciation",
    "nickname": "Nickname"
    // ... rest of your data
  }
}
```

### 3. Add More Versions

Create additional JSON files in the `data/` folder:

- `data/tech-focused.json` - For tech roles
- `data/business-focused.json` - For business roles
- `data/creative-focused.json` - For creative roles

### 4. Launch & Print

Open `index.html` in any web browser, select your preferred version, and hit **Ctrl+P** (or **Cmd+P** on Mac) to print. That's it! üéâ

**Real Example**: Check out how the current `profile.json` creates a complete PhD researcher resume with multiple specialized versions - just by editing JSON data!
